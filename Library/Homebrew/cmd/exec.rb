          `exec`, `x` [`--skip-update`] [`--formulae=`<formulae>] [`--`] <command> [<args> ...]

          Run <command> in an environment populated by Homebrew formulae.

          If `--formulae` is passed, Homebrew installs those comma-separated
          formulae if needed, prepends their executable directories and those of
          their dependencies to `PATH` and runs <command>. This allows <command>
          to be a script path such as `./script.sh`.

          If `--formulae` is omitted, Homebrew finds a formula that provides
          <command>, installs it if needed and runs that executable.

          Example: `brew exec --formulae=jq,yq -- ./script.sh`

          Scripts can also use a shebang on systems with `env -S`:
          `#!/usr/bin/env -S brew exec --formulae=jq,yq --`
